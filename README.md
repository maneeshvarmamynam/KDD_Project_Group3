# Project Description:
Project investigates the relationship between mobile phone usage, academic performance, and health among university students using a dataset of students information form Kaggle. The dataset includes detailed information on students' ages, genders, mobile phone ownership, usage patterns for educational purposes, perceptions of usefulness, reported health symptoms, and overall academic performance. The aim is to understand how mobile phone usage influences students' academic success and health outcomes, offering insights into potential areas for targeted interventions.

Our project is descriptive and diagnostic in nature. We seek to elucidate current patterns and relationships within the data and diagnose potential factors influencing students' academic and health metrics. To achieve this, we will employ both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques:

Unsupervised Learning: We will use clustering methods, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to segment students into distinct groups based on their mobile phone usage patterns and health symptoms. This will help identify common profiles within the student population, such as those with heavy mobile phone use and high levels of reported health issues.

Supervised Learning: We will apply logistic regression to predict the perceived impact of mobile phone usage on academic performance. This method will allow us to determine how factors such as mobile phone use frequency and reported health symptoms influence students' perceptions of their academic performance.

Additionally, we will explore association rules to uncover significant relationships between mobile phone activities and health symptoms. This approach will help identify patterns and dependencies that could inform targeted recommendations for students' mobile phone usage to improve academic and health outcomes.

Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of how mobile phone usage affects students' academic performance and health, facilitating the development of evidence-based strategies for enhancing student well-being and academic achievement.
